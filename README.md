#prime-number-generator
First we create an array, therefore we can store the data.
We introduce the class int to cast the input parameter as a number. 
We define the function "isPrime" so if th "isPrime" is true, that means that the function is going to print all the prime numbers from 2 to the number that was introduce. We know that a prime number has to have a reminder equal to 0. So if it is not true, then the program does not keep the numbers. 
If the number is a prime number, it is stored in a list. 
We define again a new function which is a recursive one and takes a number, included in the range, and analyses wether it is a prime number or not. Then it takes the previous number of the one that it has taken before an it checks again if it is a prime number or not. This happens successively until we reach the final number.
